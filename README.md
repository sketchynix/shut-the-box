##Shut the Box##
The game is built with SASS, React, Flummox (flux-like architecture), Webpack, and Babel.
I used the Yeoman React Webpack generator to create the project.
I wrote the logic in a framework I was comfortable with, Angular, and then ported it over to the Flummox framework.
I am not entirely sure yet if the data-flow is correct or if the component separation is correct.
I still have to do unit tests, but the game logic is complete.

###Installation###
Run NPM install after downloading the repository and files

In the node command line run `grunt serve`
You should see a browser tab open with the game
